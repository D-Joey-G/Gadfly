# Character Avatars

This directory is for storing character avatar images to be used in the Hyper-Platonic forum.

## Naming Convention

Save avatar images with the following naming convention:
- Lowercase character name
- Spaces replaced with underscores
- .jpg or .png format

## Examples

- socrates.jpg
- crito.jpg
- glaucon.jpg
- thrasymachus.jpg
- protagoras.jpg

## Recommended Size

- 100x100 pixels (square)
- If using different dimensions, ensure they maintain a 1:1 aspect ratio

## Style Guidelines

For a consistent look:
- Portraits or busts in ancient Greek style
- Consistent lighting and backgrounds
- Faces should be clearly visible
- Consider using AI generation tools with consistent prompts

## Adding to the Forum

Once you've added avatar images to this directory, the forum will automatically display them in place of the character name placeholders.
